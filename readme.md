# Fixed Size Static Allocated Buffer Pool in C++

A demonstration of a fixed size buffer pool in C++11 that avoids dynamic memory allocation.

- See [buffer_pool.h](buffer_pool.h) for the buffer pool template
- See [app.cpp](app.cpp) for the buffer pool template being exercised

To build and run app.cpp, from terminal call `make`, then `./bin/app`.
